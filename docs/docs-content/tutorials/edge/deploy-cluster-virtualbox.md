This tutorial will teach you how to deploy an Edge cluster using a VirtualBox VM as the Edge host. You will learn how to
build the required [Edge artifacts](../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/palette-canvos.md) and create
an Edge cluster profile. Then, you will prepare your Edge host and deploy an Edge cluster along with a demo application.

The diagram below illustrates the components that will be deployed in this tutorial and how they interact with each
other.
